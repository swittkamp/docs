title: "Automate Password Reset Using the QuikQ API"
mode: "wide"
---

When using the `api.quikq.com/v1/auth` endpoint for authentication, the JWT token response includes a property called uX. This value represents the **account's expiration time in Unix timestamp format**.

<Note>
  By monitoring this uX value, clients can proactively trigger a password reset before the account expires, **without waiting for manual intervention**.
</Note>

## How It Works

1. **Authenticate Using** `/v1/auth`

   A successful login returns a JWT token with a uX property:

   The uX value is the Unix datetime (in seconds) indicating when the current password will expire.
2. **Monitor Password Expiry**

   In your client or automation code, regularly check the current time against the uX value. When nearing expiration (e.g., within 24 hours), initiate a reset.
3. **Trigger a Password Reset Automatically**

   When ready, call the endpoint:

   This endpoint will issue a new password and return it in the response.

<Note>
  **Reminder: Stop and Restart Your Services**

  Before triggering an automated password reset with `/v1/auth/resetPassword`, you **must stop all QuikQ-related services that depend on the current credentials**.
</Note>

<Note>
  For complete guidance on the process to stop and restart services, please refer to the **QuikQ Auth API document**, which outlines the required steps to stop services prior to the password reset and restart them afterward to avoid authentication failures or service disruptions.
</Note>

4. **Once the new password is received:**
   - Update your stored credentials.
   - Restart all QuikQ-related services to resume normal operation.
