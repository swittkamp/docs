title: "Automating Password Reset Using the QuikQ API"
mode: "wide"

When using the `api.quikq.com/v1/auth` endpoint for authentication, the JWT token response includes a property called uX. The uX value is the Unix(Epoch) time (in seconds) identifying when the current password for the authenticated account will expire. The JWT token must be decoded to show the uX property.

By monitoring this uX value, clients can proactively trigger a password reset before the account expires, **without waiting for manual intervention**.

## How It Works

1. **Authenticate Using** `/v1/auth`

   A successful authentication returns the following response containing a JWT token:

   ```json
   	{
   		"status": "success",
   		"message": "Authentication success",
   		"data": {
   	    	"token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIzNzU1N..."
   		}
   	}
   ```

   <Note>
     The JWT token value is unique to each successful authentication response.
   </Note>
2. **Monitor Password Expiration**

   In your client or automation code, regularly check the current date and time against the uX value. When nearing expiration (e.g., within 24 hours), initiate a reset.
   - To show the uX value, decode the JWT token using the https://www.jwt.io/ website. Here is an example of the decoded properties:

   ```json
   {
     "sub": "37555",
     "acode": "##0001",
     "roles": "TSADMIN",
     "version": "v2",
     "uX": 1762864254,
     "exp": 1755090054
    }
   ```
   - To convert the uX value from Unix(Epoch) time to a human-readable date and time, use the https://www.epochconverter.io/ website. The uX value in the example above converts to Tuesday, Nov 11, 2025 06:30:54.000 AM Central Time.
3. **Trigger a Password Reset Automatically**


   Before calling the endpoint `/v1/auth/resetPassword`, you **must stop all QuikQ-related services that depend on the current credentials**.

   When ready, call the end point `/v1/auth/resetPassword\`. This endpoint will issue a new password and return it in the response.

   Once the password has been reset, restart all QuikQ-related services to resume normal operations.

   <Note>
     Before triggering an automated password reset with `/v1/auth/resetPassword`, you must stop all QuikQ-related services that depend on the current credentials to avoid authentication failures or service disruptions.
   </Note>

## Reminders: Stop and Restart Your Services

Before triggering an automated password reset with `/v1/auth/resetPassword`, you **must stop all QuikQ-related services** that depend on the current credentials. For complete guidance on this process, please refer to the **QuikQ Auth API document**, which outlines the required steps to stop services prior to the password reset and restart them afterward to avoid authentication failures or service disruptions.

Once the new password is received:

- **Update your stored credentials**.
- **Restart all related services** to resume normal operations.

**Failure to stop services before the password reset may cause repeated login failures or account lockouts.**

Please refer to the guide titled:
