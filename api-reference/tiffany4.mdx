title: "Automate Password Reset Using the QuikQ API"
mode: "wide"
---

When using the `api.quikq.com/v1/auth` endpoint for authentication, the JWT token response includes a property called uX. The uX value is the Unix Epoch datetime (in seconds) identifying when the current password for the authenticated account will expire.

<Note>
  By monitoring this uX value, clients can proactively trigger a password reset before the account expires, **without waiting for manual intervention**.
</Note>

## How It Works

1. **Authenticate Using** `/v1/auth`
   - A successful authentication returns the following response containing a JWT token:

   ```json
   	{
   		"status": "success",
   		"message": "Authentication success",
   		"data": {
   	    	"token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIzNzU1N..."
   		}
   	}
   ```

   <Note>
     The JWT token value is unique to each successful authentication response.
   </Note>

2. **Monitor Password Expiration**

      - In your client or automation code, regularly check the current time against the uX value. When nearing expiration (e.g., within 24 hours), initiate a reset.

      - Using the website https://www.jwt.io/, the JWT token can be decoded to show the uX property:

   ```json
   {
   	{
   	  "sub": "37555",
   	  "acode": "##0001",
   	  "roles": "TSADMIN",
   	  "version": "v2",
   	  "uX": 1762864254,
   	  "exp": 1755090054
   	}
   ```

1. **Trigger a Password Reset Automatically**

   When ready, call the endpoint:

   This endpoint will issue a new password and return it in the response.

<Note>
  **Reminder: Stop and Restart Your Services**

  Before triggering an automated password reset with `/v1/auth/resetPassword`, you **must stop all QuikQ-related services that depend on the current credentials**.
</Note>

<Note>
  For complete guidance on the process to stop and restart services, please refer to the **QuikQ Auth API document**, which outlines the required steps to stop services prior to the password reset and restart them afterward to avoid authentication failures or service disruptions.
</Note>

4. **Once the new password is received:**
   - Update your stored credentials.
   - Restart all QuikQ-related services to resume normal operation.
