## Overview

The Mag Cards page allows the user to add, activate, inactivate, and manage magnetic stripe cards issued to drivers or units.

## Mag Cards List

The Mag Cards list page contains all magnetic stripe cards with **Card Account #**, **Expiration Date**, **Status**, **Card Type**, and the **Driver/Unit #**. Each column in the grid can be sorted in ascending or descending order. Action buttons for `Add Card`, `Print`, `Export`, and `Filter` are located above the grid on the right-hand side.

To edit an existing Mag Card or to see the Card History, click on the record in the results grid.
